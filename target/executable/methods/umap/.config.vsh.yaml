  summary: "Reduction of high-dimensional datasets to 2D for visualization & interpretation."
  description: "Data visualisation is an important part of all stages of single-cell\
    \ analysis, from\ninitial quality control to interpretation and presentation of\
    \ final results. For bulk RNA-seq\nstudies, linear dimensionality reduction techniques\
    \ such as PCA and MDS are commonly used\nto visualise the variation between samples.\
    \ While these methods are highly effective they\ncan only be used to show the\
    \ first few components of variation which cannot fully represent\nthe increased\
    \ complexity and number of observations in single-cell datasets. For this reason\n\
    non-linear techniques (most notably t-SNE and UMAP) have become the standard for\
    \ visualising\nsingle-cell studies. These methods attempt to compress a dataset\
    \ into a two-dimensional space\nwhile attempting to capture as much of the variance\
    \ between observations as possible. Many\nmethods for solving this problem now\
    \ exist. In general these methods try to preserve distances,\nwhile some additionally\
    \ consider aspects such as density within the embedded space or conservation\n\
    of continuous trajectories. Despite almost every single-cell study using one of\
    \ these visualisations\nthere has been debate as to whether they can effectively\
    \ capture the variation in single-cell\ndatasets [@chari2023speciousart].\n\n\
    The dimensionality reduction task attempts to quantify the ability of methods\
    \ to embed the\ninformation present in complex single-cell studies into a two-dimensional\
    \ space. Thus, this task\nis specifically designed for dimensionality reduction\
    \ for visualisation and does not consider other\nuses of dimensionality reduction\
    \ in standard single-cell workflows such as improving the\nsignal-to-noise ratio\
    \ (and in fact several of the methods use PCA as a pre-processing step for this\n\
    reason). Unlike most tasks, methods for the dimensionality reduction task must\
    \ accept a matrix\ncontaining expression values normalised to 10,000 counts per\
    \ cell and log transformed (log-10k) and\nproduce a two-dimensional coordinate\
    \ for each cell. Pre-normalised matrices are required to\nenforce consistency\
    \ between the metric evaluation (which generally requires normalised data) and\n\
    the method runs. When these are not consistent, methods that use the same normalisation\
    \ as used in\nthe metric tend to score more highly. For some methods we also evaluate\
    \ the pre-processing\nrecommended by the method.\n"
