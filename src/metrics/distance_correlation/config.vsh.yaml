      label: Waypoint Distance Correlation
      summary: "Calculates the distance correlation by computing Spearman correlations between distances to waypoint cells."
      description: |
        Calculates the distance correlation by computing Spearman correlations
        between distances to waypoint cells on the full (or processed) data
        matrix and the dimensionally-reduced matrix. Also known as the
        cellstruct global single-cell (GS) score when using Pearson correlation.
